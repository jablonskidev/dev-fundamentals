# Dev Fundamentals

## What Is This?

In this repo, you'll learn **foundational skills** that are useful for **software developers**.

I'm going to start by writing short resources about the command line and git. As I write more and cover more topics, I plan to reorganize content to make this repo a more cohesive resource for learners.

## What Does This Cover?

Table of contents:
- Command line
- [Git](https://github.com/jablonskidev/dev-fundamentals/blob/main/git-first-steps.md)
- APIs
- Databases

## Who Am I?

I help developers learn because I like code, words, and people.
