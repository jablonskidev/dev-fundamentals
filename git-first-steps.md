## What Is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) tool used by developers and technical writers. Version control tools help you keep track of the changes that have been made to files.

Version control helps you:
- See what changes were made when, who made them, and why they were made
- Return to an earlier version of the file if you want to undo changes

Using version control is useful for all projects, but it's especially important for projects that have more than one person involved since they may be working on the same files at the same time.

## How Do You Get Git?

Got to the git site to:
- [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Set up git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

## How Do You Use Git?

To start using git with GitHub, you'll need to know how to:
- Create a [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control))
- Add files to the repository
- [Commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)) changes
- Push changes to a remote repository
- Pull changes from a remote repository

Now that you know what git is and how to use it, you can practice using it with your next personal project.
