## What Is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) tool used by developers and technical writers. Version control tools help you keep track of the changes that have been made to a file.

Version control helps you:
- See what changes were made when, who made them, and why they were made
- Return to an earlier version of the file if you want to undo changes

Using version control is useful for all projects, but it's especially important for projects that have more than one person involved since they may be working on the same files at the same time.
